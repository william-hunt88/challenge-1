I viewed the source code AND:
changed several of the <div> elements to better represent their contents & further accessibility. 

I viewed the structure of the HTML elements AND:
confirmed that it is laid out in a functional and logical way.

I viewed the <img> elements AND:
added "alt" attributes to further increase accesibilty, especially for the deaf or hard of hearing.

I viewed the heading attributes AND:
confirmed that they fall in sequential order except for the footer which I changed to an <h4>.

I viewed the <title> element AND:
Changed it to better represent the websites purpose.

Aside from these main goals I:

consolidated several CSS class style declarations, reducing duplicate code in my stylesheet. 

took out several spaces which were causing some <p> elements to appear on 3 lines.

added the proper class to the "search engine optimization" section in order to fix the link in the nav bar.

changed some class names to better represent the sections and content they were assigned to.

rearranged the CSS delcarations into a more logical order and provided notes for context.
